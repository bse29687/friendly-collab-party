* First, we need some beer. Here some of my favourites:
 - Howe Sound King Heffy
 - St. Bernardus Triple
 - Phillips Blue Buck Ale
* Also, Ice cream would be great. My best one is from ["La casa gelato"](http://www.vancitybuzz.com/2013/06/best-ice-cream-spots-in-vancouver-la-casa-gelato/)



Ok. This is my sugestion for the menu:
tortilla de patata
red peppers stuffed with cream cheese and tune
Empanada
huevos rellenos
mediterranean salad

This is gonna be tasty (if you like Spanish food)!

I think we should have LOTS of cake
* black forest cake
* chocolate cake
* cheese cake
* icecream cake
* apple pie
